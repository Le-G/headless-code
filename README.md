# Headless VS code

This is a simple headless development environment to be used though VS code tunnels.

## Why not VS code server ?

VS code server only offers the possibility to expose a port and connect through a web UI with a password.
This allows to use both web and VS code as clients, and use github auth instead of password auth.
